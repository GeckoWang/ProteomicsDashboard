#  Thyroid Proteomics Dashboard

This is an interactive web application built with Dash, designed to display protein expression data across different 
histopathological types of thyroid tissue and provide various visualization and statistical analysis features.



## ðŸ”˜ Project Overview

By selecting a histopathological category (such as normal tissue, thyroid adenoma, thyroid carcinoma, etc.) and a specific protein name, the application presents the following:

- ðŸ“Š **Protein Expression Boxplot**: Shows the distribution of the selected protein across different tissue types.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Protein Expression Rank Plot**: Displays the overall expression ranking of the selected protein.
- ðŸ“Š **Rank Plot Comparison Across Tissue Types**: Compares the changes in expression ranking among different tissue categories.
- ðŸ“Š **Statistical Analysis**: Supports differential expression analysis using t-tests, ANOVA, etc., with significance levels clearly indicated.

## ðŸ”¸ Note

This project is based on real medical proteomics data, but the original dataset is currently not publicly available.
